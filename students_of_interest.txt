I'd like to add some new logic where if i select a student (from the drop down list), The display switches to show a full overview of the student. Im after a table with all submissions with all metrics and ai scores, the another table + graph of the min, P20, mean, min, P80, max and standard dev, of the baseline (non-ai results), then a drop down to choose a given exam_result to plot the metrics of that exam on the baseline statistics. Regardind the baseline, please provide inputs for the low_ai_score_threshold (max and/or average) and the minimum words.
